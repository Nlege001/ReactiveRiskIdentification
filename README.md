# Tech For Good Inc - Summer Internship 2021

## Introduction to IDDPS (Impared Driver Detection and Prevention System)

##### I worked on a project called the IDDPS (Impared Driver Detection and Prevention System). The main aim of this project is to reduce traffic accidents that are caused by distracted drivers which can be texting, drunk and the like.

##### I worked on a team called CV3, which is basically one of threee machine learning teams that works on making models that will detect dsitracted drivers during the driving. In our case, these srivers are usually texting, not focusing on the road or not paying attention to their frontal view.
